	h2 How to arrive: 
	ol
		li By train
			p.
				#[strong Palencia] can be easily reached in less than 2	hours from #[strong Madrid-Chamartín Station]. There are more than 10 trains every day. We advise you to come by train from Madrid if you fly to Madrid. Tickets can be bought online at the #[a(href="http://www.renfe.com/") RENFE webpage].

			p.
				#[strong Madrid-Chamartín Station] can be reached by #[em Cercanías] train from #[strong Madrid-Barajas Airport] (#[strong Terminal 4 Station]) in 15 minutes.  There is a train every 20 minutes. Tickets can be bought at the	machines in the station. (If you have a Madrid-Palencia	ticket, the Barajas-Chamartín ticket can be obtained for free from those machines using the #[em Combinado de Cercanías] option). From other terminals you either go to Terminal 4 by bus or Metro (subway) or (more expensive) take the subway to #[strong Nuevos Ministerios] and then a Cercanías train from Nuevos Ministerios to Chamartín (again, free ticket in	Cercanías if you already hold a Madrid-Palencia ticket).

			p.
				From #[strong Barcelona] you can either fly to #[strong Valladolid-Villanubla Airport] (1 hour flight plus the usual controls), take the bus to the downtown railway station (30 minutes) and a train to Palencia (30-40 minutes) or the high speed train (AVE) from Barcelona to #[strong Madrid-Atocha Station] (3 hours), a Cercanías train from Atocha to Chamartín (free ticket again in the same conditions) (15 minutes) and another train from Chamartín to Palencia (1:50).

			p.
				From #[strong Santander, Bilbao or Oviedo] (these three places have flight connections to several cities in Europe, see below) you can either take the train (2-3 hours) or a bus (this is the best option from #[strong Bilbao] since there are very few connections every day).

			p.
				#[strong Parking]: there are several free public parking lots not far from the center and the conference venue, but there are many safe places outside the center but close to it to leave the car (parking is limited in the center).

				h2 How to arrive: 1. By train
				div
					p.
						#[strong Palencia] can be easily reached in less than 2	hours from #[strong Madrid-Chamartín Station]. There are more than 10 trains every day.

(If you have a Madrid-Palencia	ticket, the Barajas-Chamartín ticket can be obtained for free from those machines using the #[em Combinado de Cercanías] option). From other terminals you either go to Terminal 4 by bus or Metro (subway) or (more expensive) take the subway to #[strong Nuevos Ministerios] and then a Cercanías train from Nuevos Ministerios to Chamartín (again, free ticket in	Cercanías if you already hold a Madrid-Palencia ticket).

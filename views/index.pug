			The Spanish-Portuguese Relativity Meeting #[a(href="http://www.segre.es/en/congresos.shtml") (EREP)] is the main meeting of researchers working on gravity and relativity in Portugal and Spain. It is backed by the #[strong Sociedad Española de Gravitación y Relatividad] (#[a(href="http://segre.es") SEGRE]) and by the #[strong Sociedade Portuguesa de Relatividade e Gravitação]  (#[a(href="https://sprg.tecnico.ulisboa.pt") SPRG]).

			The 2018 edition is organized by the Institute of Theoretical Physics (#[a(href="http://ift.uam-csic.es/en/front") IFT-UAM/CSIC]) and will take place in Palencia (Spain), the days 4, 5, 6 and 7 of September 2018. A small city with a long history which was home to the #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Palencia") first University in the Iberian Peninsula] (1212), where everything is within walking distance and where there will be plenty of places and time to interact.

		p.
			We are planning an attractive scientific meeting with an attractive social and outreach program for all participants.
